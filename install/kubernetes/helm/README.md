# Installation using Helm

Please follow the installation instructions from [istio.io](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/install/helm/).

# Development

Istio installation is based upon a new decomposed installation technology in Istio 1.2.  As such, all development work should occur in [istio/installer](https://github.com/istio/installer).

If you have work that you feel should be backported to resolve defects, please submit to this repository on the release-1.1 branch so it can be added to the 1.1.x stream.
